### Cutter Selection

Before cutting make sure you have the right cutter selected by clicking the name of the Glowforge in the top right and selecting which machine you are using.

The "Glowforge" has the slot in the front for passthrough cutting while the "Glowforge II" does not.

### Last Rearrangement

Once you are ready to print, look at the material image on the workspace and make sure that the object is in the right location.

The two things to look out for are:

1. Make sure your object is not over any holes in your material.

2. If possible, try to move your object to leave the biggest space possible for others to cut.

### Printing

When you are ready to print, click the {{% badge %}}Print{{% /badge %}} button in the top right.

From there the printer will begin the printing process, and eventually show a menu.

When this menu shows, check once again that your object is not over any holes as the bed image often shifts slightly when you do this.

Once you are confident it will print correctly, move to the laser cutter and hit the flashing white button. Your design should begin printing.

If you need to cancel at any time, just hit the {{% badge %}}cancel print{{% /badge %}} button on the computer.
