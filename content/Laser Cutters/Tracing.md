To trace an image into the laser cutter, place the drawing or art you wish to trace in the machine and close the lid.

Image

Then either go to the Glowforge home menu and hit *Create New Design* and *Trace Artwork* or open a workspace and hit the (icon) icon and then the {{% badge %}}Trace{{% /badge %}} button in the top right. This will open up an image of the bed and anything in it.

Image

Now simply drag your mouse over the art you wish to trace.

Image

This will show a black and white scan of the artwork. If you wish to cut an outline of any section of the art, click that area and it will outline it in purple. 

Images

Once you have selected all areas to cut, hit the {{% badge %}}Place Artwork{{% /badge %}} button in the top right.

Image

This will place an engraving of the art, as well as cut lines anywhere you selected, with the two grouped together. Right click and hit *Ungroup* to seperate the two.
