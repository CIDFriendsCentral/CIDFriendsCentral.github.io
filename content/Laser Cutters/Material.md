Once your design is ready, select what material you wish to use from the bins near the laser cutters.

Once you have loaded the material into the cutter, go to the top left corner of your workspace and click the button which will either be labeled *Unknown Material* or some other material name. This will open up a menu.

Use the search bar to select the type of material you are using. In general it is best to call anything less than 1/8 inch medium, and anything greater then or equal to 1/8 inch thick.

Once you have selected your material, move to the settings page.
