To begin to create a 3D part, meaning any shape that is not a flat design or simple prism, you will want to create the file outside of Aspire first. There is some modeling functionality in Aspire but it will be much easier to create the part with a different software.Once you have your 3d part created, export it as an .obj or .stl file.

Once you have your file, open it with Aspire, edit the job settings as you would with a 2d part, and you will have your file, likely much larger than you intended.

To fix this you should change the dimensions in the options box that appears on the side of the screen.

Within this box you can also rotate it with the profile buttons and the boxes for rotation. Keep in mind that the Shopbot can only cut downwards and not to the side, so keep in mind how your model is oriented and you will have all of the holes you intended.

When you are satisfied hit the {{% badge %}}Position And Import{{% /badge %}} button.

Since the Shopbot cannot cut both the top and bottom of a piece at the same time, it will cut the top and bottom halves separately. You can adjust this by changing the number in the second option box.

When you do that, the models will appear on top of each other in the 2d view, choose the move tool (cursor with a cross) and move one of the 2 objects away so they do not overlap

Next go to the drawing tools and get the rectangle tool. Create a rectangle around both of your parts.

Then move to the rough/smooth carve section.
