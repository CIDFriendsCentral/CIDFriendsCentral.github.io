The CNC is the biggest and most heavy-duty piece of machinery in the CID. It can cut very large objects and is good for both 2D and 3D pieces, although it has some limitations when working in 3D. It can be used to cut wood, acrylic, stone, metal, and many more materials. It is also the most dangerous of the machines so please take extreme care when using it:
