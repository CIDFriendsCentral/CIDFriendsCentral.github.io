The two most common things to go wrong are a USB Control Box Problem or True Zero getting reset wrong.

### USB Control Box Problems

A USB control box problem happens when there is a yellow box on the computer that says there's a "USB control box problem!".

When there is a USB control box problem, it usually means there has been a problem with the power. Reset the power box, and then press "retry control box" on the computer.

If resetting the power box does not fix the problem, try these steps:
- Turning the shopbot on and off via the red on switch on the right side
- Closing and restarting the shopbot program on the computer (if it does not close, you may have to end the task in the task manager).
- Unplugging and then re-plugging the shopbot cord from the computer. The shopbot cord is the one on the left. You could try another port, but the one on the right seems to not work for the shopbot. So use the left one.
- Restarting the computer. Ask a CID co-director for the password when it turns back on.
