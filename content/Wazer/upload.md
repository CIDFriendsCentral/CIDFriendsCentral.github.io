A menu will pop up wil a few options.

Firstly, you can drag the object around the bed to position it or use the `X Position` and `Y Position` boxes to move it to a specific location.

You can rotate it with the `Rotation` box by inputting how many degrees you want to rotate it.

You can scale it to a percentage of the original size with the `Scale` box or set a certain width or height with the `Width` and `Height` box. The object will retain the same proportions so width and height will scale regularly.

## Done?

Once you are happy with the positioning, move to the Cut Settings page
