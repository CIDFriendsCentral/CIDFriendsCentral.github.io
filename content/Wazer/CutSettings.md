This will show the exact way that the cutter will cut your file. if you want to keep the piece outside of your file select inside, and if you want to keep the piece inside of your file select outside. Otherwise hit centerline.

`Offset` will dedicate how far the cut line will be outside or inside the file line.

### Tabs and Leads

Select `Tabs and Leads` next.

Tabs will be little bits of material that keep the material steady while cutting. You can either choose to manually place tabs by clicking along your path, or choose a number of tabs in the `Tab count` box and click `Automatic Tab Placement`.

Leads will tell the machine to stray off the cut path to make more precise cuts and eliminate the bits leftover from removing tabs. Only use this if you only care about one of the two pieces you will cut.

### Cut File

FInally select `Cut`.

There you can select the quality of your cut, where higher quality takes more time and sediment.

Finally type the name of the file for identification on the machine.

Once you are done that, hit `Generate Job File` and the g-code will download to your computer.

## Done?

Once you have done this, move to the securing section.
