Before you start your cut, make sure that the water and sediment are set up properly.



Firstly, if the water level in the wazer is too low, use the hose to fill it until the water level is even with the cut bed. 



Then to set up the sediment, go to the left side of the Wazer and pull out the drawer.

Then slowly pour the abrasive through the screens on top of the cups until the cups are full.

Next we will remove the used sediment. Open the lid and remove the front black panel inside the machine.

Inside you will see two buckets. Empty them into the used sediment bin.

Then replace the black panel.



Make sure the water supply is on and you are ready to cut.
