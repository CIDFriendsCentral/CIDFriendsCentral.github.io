Then underneath should appear a row named `AzureGoshawk` which you should select.

### Choose Material

Select whatever material is currently loaded in the printer.

### Choose Layer Thickness

Layer thickness will change how fast the file prints as well as the resolution of the product. Use 0.1 mm for most prints, or smaller if you need super precise detail.

Don't worry about the **Other Settings** as we do not have the hardware for those.

## Done?

When you are happy with your settings, hit the {{% badge %}}Apply{{% /badge %}} button in the bottom right and move to the printing section.
