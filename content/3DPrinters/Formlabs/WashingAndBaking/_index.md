These steps will use the two black machines next to the Formlabs printer.

First, take your pieces and place them in the washing basin.

Click the knob to power the machine on, and then click it again to start the washing. You can change the settings with the dial but they will be set up for washing for you.

Once your pieces are done washing, you can take them out and move them into the second black box, to bake them.

Place your pieces inside, close the lid, and click the knob once to activate the machine.

The menu that pops up will show options for time and temperature. Use the guide on the wall to select the correct settings for your material, however 30 minutes at 60 degrees will work for the common resins that the printer will have loaded.

When the baking process is done, the print is complete!
