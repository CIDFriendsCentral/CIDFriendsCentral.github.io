To remove the print from the bed, first put on latex gloves as resin can be harmful to your skin with frequent contact.

Then open the casing around the printer by pulling up on the handle.

Inside, you will see your print attached upside-down to the print bed, and a mechanism holding the bed.

Unhook the latch holding the bed on and remove the print bed.

From there, get a scraper and carefully use it to pry the print off.

Once all of your pieces are detached from the bed, proceed to the [Washing and Baking](https://cid.friendscentral.org/3dprinters/formlabs/washingandbaking/index.html) section.
