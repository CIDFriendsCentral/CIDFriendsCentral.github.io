Once you are ready to print, hit the {{% badge %}}Upload Print{{% /badge %}} button and a menu will appear. This is the same menu that will appear when you use the *One-Click Print* feature.

In this menu you can either press *Add to Queue* or *Print Now*.

*Add to Queue* adds it to the list of prints available on the printer.

*Print Now* starts the job immediately. Your object should print shortly.

Once the print has finished, go to the removing print section.
