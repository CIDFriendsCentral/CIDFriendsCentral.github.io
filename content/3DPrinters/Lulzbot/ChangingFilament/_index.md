To change filament on the LulzBot, first open the **Cura LulzBot** application, and navigate to the monitor tab.

Click the {{% badge %}}Connect{{% /badge %}} button and wait a few seconds. Eventually the box at the top will read *Connected to Printer*.

Once that happens move back to the right menu. Click the {{% badge %}}Pre-Heat{{% /badge %}} buttons on the *Hot End* section only.

Then wait until the larger black number changes to match the smaller grey number.

Now scroll down to the *Manual Printer Control* section.

Change the number in *Extrude Amount* to 100, then hit the {{% badge %}}Retract{{% /badge %}} button. Then gently pull upwards on the filament.

To load filament, use the same process as above, but set the number to 80 instead of 100 and hit the {{% badge %}}Extrude{{% /badge %}} button while gently pushing the filament in.
