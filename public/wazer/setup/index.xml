    <description>Before you start your cut, make sure that the water and sediment are set up properly.&#xA;Firstly, if the water level in the wazer is too low, use the hose to fill it until the water level is even with the cut bed.&#xA;Then to set up the sediment, go to the left side of the Wazer and pull out the drawer.&#xA;Then slowly pour the abrasive through the screens on top of the cups until the cups are full.</description>
