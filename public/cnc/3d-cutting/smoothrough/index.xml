    <description>Once you have your file set up correctly, select both of your pieces and the rectangle around them and select the rough machining toolpath.&#xA;Select your bit and make sure that `Machining Limit Boundary is set to “Selected Vectors.” Then Hit calculate. Your toolpath should look like a rough outline of your shape&#xA;Now go back, select both pieces and the rectangle, and select Finish Machining Toolpath.&#xA;Now for the bit selection, hit Select and then look for a bit that is the same size as the one you used for the first path, but says (Smooth Carve) on the end.</description>
