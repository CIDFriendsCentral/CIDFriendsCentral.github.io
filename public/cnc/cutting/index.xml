    <description>Once you have the file, and have secured your material and warmed up the machine, open the shopbot app and make sure youâ€™re in shopbot easy mode.&#xA;Then open the manual control panel by clicking the yellow box.&#xA;You will zero the X and Y at the same time. Before you zero the X and Y, make sure the piece of wood (or other material) is in the machine, not crooked, and is held down in some way.</description>
