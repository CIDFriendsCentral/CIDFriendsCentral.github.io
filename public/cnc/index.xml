      <description>Once you have the file, and have secured your material and warmed up the machine, open the shopbot app and make sure you’re in shopbot easy mode.&#xA;Then open the manual control panel by clicking the yellow box&#xA;You will zero the X and Y at the same time. Before you zero the X and Y, make sure the piece of wood (or other material) is in the machine, not crooked, and is held down in some way.</description>

      <description>Once you are ready to secure your material to the bed, first take blue tape or painters tape and cover the bottom surface of your material in the area of your cut and the area on the bed where you want to attach the object.&#xA;Then take superglue and put a thin spread on the tape on the bed. DO NOT PUT SUPERGLUE ON THE BED ITSELF. Take the accelerant and spray it onto the tape on the bottom of your object, and push the object down onto the bed and hold it there for a few seconds.</description>

      <description>The two most common things to go wrong are a USB Control Box Problem or True Zero getting reset wrong&#xA;USB Control Box Problems A USB control box problem happens when there is a yellow box on the computer that says there’s a “USB control box problem!”.&#xA;When there is a USB control box problem, it usually means there has been a problem with the power. Reset the power box, and then press “retry control box” on the computer.</description>
