    <description> The CNC machine has some good options for cutting simple but large 3D parts. Careful use of the settings is important here to get good results. Use these guides for 3D file setup:&#xA;Uploading 3D Files&#xA;Smooth and Rough Carving</description>

      <description> To begin to create a 3D part, meaning any shape that is not a flat design or simple prism, you will want to create the file outside of Aspire first. There is some modeling functionality in Aspire but it will be much easier to create the part with a different software.Once you have your 3d part created, export it as an .obj or .stl file.&#xA;Once you have your file, open it with Aspire, edit the job settings as you would with a 2d part, and you will have your file, likely much larger than you intended.</description>

      <description> Once you have your file set up correctly, select both of your pieces and the rectangle around them and select the rough machining toolpath.&#xA;Select your bit and make sure that `Machining Limit Boundary is set to “Selected Vectors.” Then Hit calculate. Your toolpath should look like a rough outline of your shape</description>
