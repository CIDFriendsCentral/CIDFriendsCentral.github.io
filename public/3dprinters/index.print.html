<h1 id="uploading-files">Uploading Files</h1>

<hr>
<p>To upload files to the FormLabs printer first open the <strong>PreForm</strong> application.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Then drag and drop your intended file into the work area of the window</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>From here you have a few options about how to set up your print.</p>
<h3 id="one-click-print">One Click Print</h3>
<p>The simplest is to hit the (icon) icon and use <em>One Click Print</em></p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Hit the <em>Set Up Your Print</em> button and the app will automatically rotate your model and add supports for the best print generation.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>It will also pop up the printing menu, which we will discuss in the <strong>Printing</strong> section.</p>
<h2 id="manual-setup">Manual Setup</h2>
<h3 id="moving-and-rotation">Moving and Rotation</h3>
<p>To move the print around the print bed, first click the item you wish to move, and you will see two arrows pop up around your shape, ass well as 3 quarter rings.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>Once that happens you can either move it on the main axis by dragging those arrows, or just grab and drag the object to wherever you want it.</p>
<p>You can also rotate it by grabbing and dragging the quarter rings or the (icon) icon</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>It is reccomended to rotate the object so that the least amount of overhang is acheived:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>And there are no shapes that create cups:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Again a menu with certain options will also appear next to the (icon) icon</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>The <em>Auto-Orient Selected</em> will rotate the object to have the optimal setup.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>the <em>Orient To Face</em> button will allow you to click on a face of the print and the program will lay it flat against the print bed such that the arrow that appears will point straight down into the bed.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>You can also edit it&rsquo;s rotation more precicely by clicking the arrows next to <em>Orient X</em>, <em>Orient Y</em>, and <em>Orient Z</em> to rotate it around those axis.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>There also is a handfull of options labeled <em>Orient To Bounding Box</em>. This will lay the face of the rectangular box around the object flat against the bed.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Finally the <em>Reset Selected</em> Button will return the object to it&rsquo;s original orientation.</p>
<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>
<p>To scale your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon. A menu will appear next to the icon.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>The text boxes allow you to set the scale of the object by a multiple of it&rsquo;s current size and scale it evenly across all axis, or scale the axis seperately to the size you specify.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>The <em>Reset</em> button will set the object to it&rsquo;s original dimentions</p>
<p>Alternatively, when you select the object you can grab and drag the (icon) icon the scale it evenly.</p>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<p>To manage the layout of the bed, select your object and hit the (icon) icon. A menu will then appear.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h4 id="auto-layout">Auto Layout</h4>
<p>To automatically layout your objects, you can change the <em>Model Spacing</em> and choose whether to select <em>Overlap Rafts</em> and <em>Lock Rotation</em>. Then hit the <em>Layout All</em> Button.</p>
<p><em>Model Spacing</em> Will dictate how close the pieces end up after placement.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Overlap Rafts</em> dictates if the support rafts can overlap</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Lock Rotation</em> stops the program from rotating the models while arranging them.</p>
<h4 id="duplication">Duplication</h4>
<p>To duplicate your model, first select how many copies you want, then hit the <em>Create</em> button</p>
<h4 id="array">Array</h4>
<p>Array will duplicate your models in a regular pattern, with a specified number of rows and columns and specified spacing.</p>
<h4 id="mirroring">Mirroring</h4>
<p>Hit the <em>Mirror Models</em> button to mirror all selected models.</p>
<h3 id="supports">Supports</h3>
<p>To generate supports for your model, hit the (icon) icon and a menu will appear. If you select an object or objects, you can generate supports only for the selected objects, or alternatively generate supports for all objects by not selecting any one particular object.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Firstly, you can automatically generate the supports by hitting the <em>Auto-Generate All</em> Button.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>You can paint on supports by hitting the <em>Edit</em> button, but the details of that will not be covered here. It is reccomended to use the Auto-Generate option instead.</p>
<p>You can edit the way supports generate in the <strong>Basic Settings</strong> section.</p>
<p><em>Raft Type</em> will change how the support raft generates, either Full Rafts, Mini Rafts, or None</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Raft Label</em> will place the name of the object on the rim of the raft</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Density</em> Changes how often the supports will be placed</p>
<p><em>Touchpoint Size</em> Changes the area of the contact between the support and object</p>
<p><em>Internal Supports</em> will generate supports between different layers of the object</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Settings</strong> has more particular details but will not be covered on this guide.</p>
<p>Hitting the <em>Reset</em> button will reset the objects completely.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with object and support placement, move to the <em>Printer Settings</em> Section.</p>

<h1 id="printer-settings">Printer Settings</h1>

<hr>
<p>Now that you have your print set up, click the <em>Printer</em> button in the top left</p>
<h3 id="choose-printer">Choose Printer</h3>
<p>Under the choose printer section, select the dropdown and select <em>Form 3/3+</em>.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Then underneath should appear a row named <em>AzureGoshawk</em> which you should select.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="choose-material">Choose Material</h3>
<p>Select whatever material is currently loaded in the printer.</p>
<h3 id="choose-layer-thickness">Choose layer thickness</h3>
<p>Layer thickness will change how fast the file prints as well as the resolution of the product. Use 0.1 mm for most prints, or smaller if you need super precise detail.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the <strong>Other Settings</strong> as we do not have the hardware for those.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>When you are happy with your settings, hit the <em>Apply</em> button in the bottom right and move to the printing section.</p>

<h1 id="printing">Printing</h1>

<hr>
<p>Once you are ready to print, hit the <em>Upload Print</em> button and a menu will appear. This is the same menu that will appear when you use the <em>One-Click Print</em> feature.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>In this menu you can either press <em>Add to Queue</em> or <em>Print Now</em>.</p>
<p><em>Add to Queue</em> adds it to the list of prints availible on the printer.</p>
<p><em>Print Now</em> starts the job immedietely. Your object should print shortly.</p>
<p>Once the print has finished, go to the removing print section.</p>

<h1 id="removing-print">Removing Print</h1>

<hr>
<p>To remove the print from the bed, first put on latex gloves as resin can be harmful to your skin with frequent contact.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Then open the casing around the printer by pulling up on the handle</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>inside, you will see you print attached upside-down to the print bed, and a mechanism holding the bed.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Unhook the latch holding the bed on and remove the print bed.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>From there, get a scraper and carfully use it to pry the print off.</p>
<p>Image.</p>
<p>Once all of your pieces are detached from the bed, proceed to the Washing and Baking section.</p>

<h1 id="washing-and-baking">Washing And Baking</h1>

<hr>
<p>These steps will use the two black machines next to the formlabs printer.</p>
<p>Image with labels.</p>
<p>First, take your pieces and place them in the washing basin.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Click the knob to power the machine on, and then click it again to start the washing. You can change the settings with the dial but they will be set up for washing for you.</p>
<p>Image.</p>
<p>Once your pieces are done washing, you can take them out and move them into the second black box, to bake them.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Place your pieces inside, close the lid, and click the knob once to activate the machine.</p>
<p>Image.</p>
<p>The menu that pops up will show options for time and temnperature. Use the guide on the wall to select the correct settings for your material, however 30 minutes at 60 degrees will work for the common resins that the printer will have loaded.</p>
<p>When the baking process is done, the print is complete!</p>

<h1 id="uploading-files">Uploading Files</h1>

<hr>
<p>To upload files to the Ultimaker first get the stl, obj, or other 3D file type and open it with <strong>UltiMaker Cura</strong> either through opening through File Explorer or dragging the file into the <strong>UltiMaker Cura</strong> application.</p>
<p>Picture 113</p>
<p>Once the file loads in, you can move it around the buildplate and change it to your likings, or upload more files by dragging them into the application window</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<h3 id="moving">Moving</h3>
<p>To move the print around the print bed, first click the item you wish to move, then click the (icon) icon and you will see three arrows pop up around your shape</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>Once that happens you can either move it on the main axis by dragging those arrows, or just grab and drag the object to wherever you want it.</p>
<p>You can also set it&rsquo;s exact position with the menu that appears next to the (icon) icon.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>there you will also see two checkboxes, <em>Lock Model</em> and <em>Drop Down Model</em></p>
<p><em>Lock Model</em> makes it so the model cannot move other than by changing the numbers in the menu, dragging the model or arrows will no longer move it</p>
<p><em>Drop Down Model</em> makes it so the model automatically moves it&rsquo;s lowest point to be touching the print bed, and it cannot be moved upwards, but can still be moved downwards. Keep in mind that anything shown below the print bed will not be printed.</p>
<p>It is reccomended to keep the <em>Lock Model</em> unselected and <em>Drop Down Model</em> selected</p>
<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>
<p>To scale your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three lines with boxes will appear.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>You can grab any of the three to stretch the object in the direction of that line, or instead grab the central box to stratch in all directions equally.</p>
<p>Again a menu will pop up with certain options. The text boxes allow you to set the length, width, or height of the object by measured size or percentage of the original model.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>there you will also see two checkboxes, <em>Snap Scaling</em> and <em>Uniform Scaling</em> as well as a rewind icon</p>
<p><em>Snap Scaling</em> makes it so the object will snap between set sizes</p>
<p><em>Uniform Scaling</em> makes it so all the axis will scale uniformly, mneaning any change to one axis will be matched in the other two to keep the proportions of the object the same</p>
<p>The rewind icon will set the object to it&rsquo;s original dimentions</p>
<p>It is reccomended to keep the <em>Snap Scaling</em> unselected and <em>Uniform Scaling</em> selected unless you intentionally want a off proportion model</p>
<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
<p>To scale your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three rings will appear.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>You can grab these rings and rotate them to rotate the object how you would like it to print. Keep in mind where the back of the bed is, signified by the lip where it is written <em>Ultimaker S5</em>.</p>
<p>It is reccomended to rotate the object so that the least amount of overhang is acheived:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>And the maximum amount of the print is touching the build plate, shown by the light blue highlight:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Again a menu with certain options will also appear next to the (icon) icon</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>The rewind icon will return the object to it&rsquo;s original orientation</p>
<p>the (icon) icon will rotate the model as little as possible to ensure a flat surface is laying against the print bed.</p>
<p>the (icon) icon will allow you to click on a face of the print and the program will lay it flat against the print bed. This feature is somewhat inconsistent so it may take a few tries to correctly allign it</p>
<p><em>Snap Rotation</em> makes it so the print will only rotate in multiples of 15 degrees.</p>
<p>It is recoomended to keep <em>Snap Rotation</em> selected unless a particular angle is needed.</p>
<h3 id="mirroring">Mirroring</h3>
<p>When you select the (icon) icon, 6 arrows will appear.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>Clicking any of these arrows will mirror the object as if there was a mirror that the arrow was pointed directly into</p>
<h3 id="mesh-type">Mesh Type</h3>
<p>When you click the (icon) icon, a section will open that allows you to change how the object prints.</p>
<p>The first icon is the default, and will follow the print settings that you set.</p>
<p>The second prints as if is is support for a different model, which will follow the support settings that you set</p>
<p>The third will deal with overlapping objects, which is much more complicated, and a full desciprion of the options can be found here: link <a href="https://support.makerbot.com/s/article/1667417981430" rel="external" target="_blank">https://support.makerbot.com/s/article/1667417981430</a></p>
<p>The last will remove all supports in the volume of the object, but will not print the object itself</p>
<h3 id="support-blocking">Support blocking</h3>
<p>The (icon) icon will block support in a cubic area, similar to the last option of the last tool</p>
<p>To use this, click the model you want to remove supports from, click the (icon) icon, and then click where you want the blocker. You can then edit the blocker as if it was any other object, using the tools above. The print will not generate any supports in the area of this block.</p>
<h3 id="material-selection">Material selection</h3>
<p>The Ultimaker can print two materials in the same print, simply click the object and select which of the two extruders you wish to print from.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>Once you are happy with the object&rsquo;s placement, move to the print settings section.</p>

<h1 id="printer-settings">Printer Settings</h1>

<hr>
<p>Once you have your object oriented as desired, move to the print settings menu.</p>
<p>There you will see lots of options, which I will briefly review here</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="profiles">Profiles</h3>
<p>Firstly you will see a list of <strong>Profiles</strong>. These are the easiest way to select your settings.</p>
<p><em>Balanced</em> strikes a balance of productivity, quality, strenth, and accuracy. Use this for general projects.</p>
<p><em>Visual</em> prioritizes the outwards appearance to optimize visual properties. Use this for projects that need to look good.</p>
<p><em>Engneering</em> prioritizes accurate tolerances, and mechanical strength. Use this for projects will moving parts or that need to be stonger.</p>
<p><em>Draft</em> is for models that are prototypes or not particularly valuable. Use this for testing and quick prints.</p>
<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>
<p>Resolution will change the thickness of every layer. The bigger each layer is the faster the model will print, but the worse it will look and function. It&rsquo;s recommended to use <em>Fine</em> for good visual quality or <em>Fast</em> for speed and basic functionality.</p>
<p>Below it may say &ldquo;Recommended settings for _____ were altered&rdquo;. Clicking the rewind icon will reset to recommended settings and the floppy disk icon will save the current settings as a new preset.</p>
<h3 id="strength">Strength</h3>
<h5 id="infill-density">Infill Density</h5>
<p>This slider will allow you to dictate how much of the interior of the print is filled in, with 0 meaning no fill, and 100 meaning completely full</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>anything down to <em>10%</em> will be self supporting enough, although <em>20%</em> is recommended for nearly every print. <em>70%</em> is the absolute maximum you need to go for a high strength print, however this should only be used if extreme strength is needed.</p>
<h5 id="infill-pattern">Infill pattern</h5>
<p>This allows for a selection of how the infill will be created, and the options are shown below:</p>
<p>Grid
Lines
Triangles
Trihexagon
Cubic
Cubic Subdivision
Octet
Quarter Cubic
Concentric
Zig Zag
Cross
Cross 3d
Gyroid
Lightning</p>
<p>Rriangles is the recommended setting but this choice has little effect on the overall print.</p>
<h5 id="shell-thickness">Shell thickness</h5>
<p>This lets you set the thickness of the outer shells of the print, with the first box designating the side walls, and the second designating the top and bottom</p>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<p>Supports are how the printer helps overhangs print, as the printer must always work from bottom to top and cannot print without a surface to print on. Support can be selected and deselected, but is recommended to use whenever there are overhangs or floating objects in your print</p>
<h5 id="support-type">Support type</h5>
<p>This box allows for two choices, <em>Normal</em> and <em>Tree</em></p>
<p><em>Normal</em> creates sheets of support under your print, connected at top and bottom:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p><em>Tree</em> creates branching circular structures to support overhangs in the model:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p><em>Normal</em> is the recommended setting unless it creates particularly hard to remove sections with print trapped between support on all sides</p>
<h5 id="placement">Placement</h5>
<p>Placement designates where supports generate, and gives two options, <em>Everywhere</em> and <em>Touching Buildplate</em></p>
<p><em>Everywhere</em> means any overhang will be supported, no matter where on the print it is.</p>
<p><em>Touching Buildplate</em> will only support overhangs over the buildplate, and overhangs that have other bits of object below will not generate support</p>
<p>It is recommended to use <em>Everywhere</em> when overhangs are present.</p>
<h3 id="adhesion">Adhesion</h3>
<p>Adhesion helps prints stick to the print bed and avoid shifting and warping off of the bed. It is recommended to keep this setting selected for any print.</p>
<h3 id="custom-settings">Custom settings</h3>
<p>Many other specific settings can be tuned by clicking <em>Show Custom</em> however there are far too many to cover in this guide, so look to a more specific guide on the Cura Slicer for information on that</p>

<h1 id="uploading-files">Uploading Files</h1>

<hr>
<p>To upload files to the Prusa Printers first get the stl, obj, or other 3D file type and open it with <strong>PrusaSlicer</strong> either through opening through File Explorer or dragging the file into the <strong>PrusaSlicer</strong> application, or clicking the (icon) icon and selecting the file.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>Once the file loads in, you can move it around the buildplate and change it to your likings, or upload more files by dragging them into the application window</p>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>In the top menu you will see a list of options</p>
<p>(icon) will allow you to add a file from file explorer</p>
<p>(icon) will delete the current selected object</p>
<p>(icon) will clear the buildplate of all objects</p>
<p>(icon) will arrange the models on the buildplate</p>
<p>(icon) will copy the selected object</p>
<p>(icon) will paste from the clipboard</p>
<p>(icon) will add a copy of that object</p>
<p>(icon) will remove a copy of that object</p>
<p>(icon) will split a seperated object into multiple objects</p>
<p>(icon) will split a seperated object into multiple parts</p>
<p>(icon) will let you search feature</p>
<p>(icon) will bring up the <em>variable layer height</em> menu which is beyond the scope of this guide and should not be used without a more comprehensive understanding of the printers.</p>
<p>(icon) undoes the last action</p>
<p>(icon) redoes the last undo</p>
<h3 id="moving">Moving</h3>
<p>To move the print around the print bed, first click the item you wish to move, then either drag your shape to its intended position, or click the (icon) icon and you will see three arrows pop up around your shape</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>Once that happens you can either move it on the main axis by dragging those arrows, or just grab and drag the object to wherever you want it.</p>
<p>You can also set it&rsquo;s exact position with the menu on the bottom right of the screen</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>there you will also see a menu with two options <em>World Coordinates</em> and <em>Object Coordinates</em>.</p>
<p><em>World Coordinates</em> lets you set position relative to the bed, with 0,0 being at the bottom left corner.</p>
<p><em>Object Coordinates</em> lets you shift the object from it&rsquo;s current position and will move it as far as you put in. You can also switch to measuring in inches by checking the inches box.</p>
<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>
<p>To scale your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three lines with boxes will appear, as well as a few orange boxes in a square around it.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>You can grab any of the three to stretch the object in the direction of that line, or instead grab one of the orange boxes to stratch in all directions equally.</p>
<p>You can also set it&rsquo;s exact scale with the menu on the bottom right of the screen</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p><em>Scale Factors</em> allows you to set the scale relative to the original object.</p>
<p><em>Size [World]</em> allows you to set the numeric size along all three axis. You can also switch to measuring in inches by checking the inches box.</p>
<p>If the lock icon is closed, the object will retain it&rsquo;s original proportions and sclae axis equally. If it is open you can manipulate the three seperately.</p>
<p>The rewind icon will set the object to it&rsquo;s original dimentions</p>
<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
<p>To rotate your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three rings will appear.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>You can grab these rings and rotate them to rotate the object how you would like it to print. Keep in mind where the front of the bed is, signified by where it is written <em>Prusa MK4</em>.</p>
<p>It is reccomended to rotate the object so that the least amount of overhang is acheived:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>And the maximum amount of the print is touching the build plate:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>You can also set it&rsquo;s exact rotation with the menu on the bottom right of the screen</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>Putting numbers in the text boxes will rotate the object in the direction of the arrows that appear as many degrees as you insert in the box.</p>
<p>You can also click the (icon) icon and your object will show white planes. Clicking one of these will orient the object so that the selected plane is touching the buildplate.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="cutting">Cutting</h3>
<p>To cut your object in 2 peices, hit the (icon) icon, and a menu will appear, as well as the cutting plane.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>In the menu you will see a selection box labeled <em>Mode</em>. Inside there are two options, <em>Planar</em> and <em>Dovetail</em></p>
<h5 id="planar">Planar</h5>
<p>When you select planar, you should first select where you would like to cut the file. The plane will automatically appear and shade the two halves of the object different colors. To adjust this cut, you can either drag the red and green arrows to tilt the plane, or grab and drag the grey ball to move the plane.</p>
<p>Images</p>
<p>You can also set the height of the cut off of the buildplate automatically in the menu</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>This will create a smooth cut into two peices.</p>
<p>If you want to instead have a more secure way of joining these peices after you cut, press the <em>Add Connectors</em> button</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>From there it will hide one of the two halves, and allow you to place connectors. You will see 3 options for the type of connector, <em>Plug</em>, <em>Dowel</em>, and <em>Snap</em>.</p>
<p>Plug creates a small protrusion from one side, and a matching hole in the other. You can select whther you would like a <em>prisim</em> or <em>frustum</em> shape:</p>
<p>images</p>
<p>As well as what shape you would like it to be, <em>triangle</em>, <em>square</em>, <em>hexagon</em>, or <em>circle</em>:</p>
<p>images</p>
<p>Dowel creates holes in both halves of the print as well as a small dowel to join the two.</p>
<p>Again you can choose the shape of the dowel, <em>triangle</em>, <em>square</em>, <em>hexagon</em>, or <em>circle</em>:</p>
<p>Snap creates a small mechanism which will snap into a hole in the other piece.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>For all of these options, you can change the Depth out of or into the piece, the horizontal size of the peg, and the rotation around it&rsquo;s center.</p>
<p>For the snap you can alter the bulge of the top section and space between connectors. Hitting the rewind icon will pu tit back to default settings.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with the settings, you can click anywhere on the orange surface to place the connector where you click.</p>
<p>Hit <em>confirm connectors</em> once you are happy with the connector position and settings or <em>cancel</em> to return to the cut menu.</p>
<h5 id="dovetail">Dovetail</h5>
<p>Dovetail will create a unique joint between the two pieces, where one will be able to slide into the other.</p>
<p>The plane will automatically appear and shade the two halves of the object different colors. To adjust this cut, you can either drag the red and green arrows to tilt the plane, grab and drag the white ball to rotate the groove, or grab and drag the grey ball or cube to move the plane.</p>
<p>images</p>
<p>You can also set the height of the cut off of the buildplate automatically in the menu</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>From there you can adjust the settings of the dovetail joint, with the sliders provided. Hitting the rewind icon on any slider will set that slider back to it&rsquo;s default position.</p>
<h4 id="cut-result">Cut Result</h4>
<p>Below the other settings, you will see a section named <em>Cut Result</em>. There you will see a column for each half of the cut. If the check box is selected the cut will generate that pice and not discard it.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>You can then select how to place the object once it cuts. <em>Keep Orientation</em> will keep the object as it is before that cut. <em>Place On Cut</em> will lay the object along the plane of the cut. <em>Flip Upside Down</em> will invert the object.</p>
<p>If you have selected planar and not added connectors, you can at the bottom select to cut into parts instead of objects, which will leave the two sides connected but allow them to have their settings edited seperately with the left parts menu</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="support-painting">Support Painting</h3>
<p>If you press the (icon) icon you can add supports in specific spots by &ldquo;painting&rdquo; with your mouse. Click and drag to add supports where you drag, and right click and drag to block supports in the certain spots you &ldquo;paint&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>You can also automatically paint areas, edit where can be painted, and edit your &ldquo;brush&rdquo; shape in the menu below.</p>
<h3 id="seam-painting">Seam Painting</h3>
<p>If you press the (icon) icon you can controll where each layer of the print starts and ends, creating a small slightly visible seam.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Clicking and dragging will force the printer to place a seam there, and right clicking and dragging will stop seams in that area.</p>
<p>You can also change the shape of your brush and view options in the menu that appears.</p>
<h3 id="measuring">Measuring</h3>
<p>To measure your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon. You can then click individual faces, edges, and points to measure the distance, angle, and areas of the parts selected.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>When you measure a length, a (icon) icon will appear, and allow you to change the length highlighted and scale the rest of the model to enforce that length.</p>
<p>In the menu you can either hit the <em>Restart Selection</em> button to clear your selection, or click the (icon) icon next to the measures to copy the numbers there.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>Once you are happy with the object&rsquo;s placement, move to the print settings section.</p>

<h3 id="print-settings">Print settings</h3>
<p>Here you will see a list of settings for layer heights:</p>
<p>0.1 mm will be the most prescise setting, good for visual detail or mechanical fucntionality</p>
<p>0.15 mm has both SPEED and STRUCTURAL options, choose SPEED for a faster print, or STRUCTURAL for a sturdier print.</p>
<p>0.2 mm has the same options, but both will be faster but lower quality than their 0.15 mm counterparts</p>
<h3 id="filament">Filament</h3>
<p>Here you can select the type of filament to be printed. Make sure this matches what is loaded in the printer before printing.</p>
<h3 id="printer">Printer</h3>
<p>Here you select which printer to use. Select <strong>Original Prusa MK4 Input Shaper 0.4 nozzle</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="supports">Supports</h3>
<p>Supports are how the printer helps overhangs print, as the printer must always work from bottom to top and cannot print without a surface to print on. Support can be selected and deselected, but is reccomended to use whenever there are overhangs or floating objects in your print</p>
<p>The options in the dropdown designate where supports generate, and gives 4 options, <em>None</em>, <em>Support on Buildplate Only</em>, <em>For Support Enforcers Only</em>, and <em>Everywhere</em>.</p>
<p><em>None</em> will not create any supports</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Support on Buildplate Only</em> will only support overhangs over the buildplate, and overhangs that have other bits of object below will not generate support</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>For Support Enforcers Only</em> only puts supports in specified spots, either by you or the model itself.</p>
<p><em>Everywhere</em> means any overhang will be supported, no matter where on the print it is.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>It is reccomended to use <em>Everywhere</em> when overhangs are present.</p>
<h3 id="infill">Infill</h3>
<p>This will allow you to dictate how much of the interior of the print is filled in, with 0 meaning no fill, and 100 meaning completely full</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>anything down to <em>10%</em> will be self supporting enough, although <em>20%</em> is reccomended for nearly every print. <em>70%</em> is the absolute maximum you need to go for a high strength print, however this should only be used if extreme strength is needed.</p>
<h3 id="brim">Brim</h3>
<p>The brim helps prints stick to the print bed and avoid shifting and warping off of the bed. It is reccomended to keep this setting selected for any print.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="part-specific-settings">Part specific settings.</h3>
<p>In the part menu, you can select and change settings for specific parts by clicking the (icon) icon</p>

<h1 id="uploading-files">Uploading Files</h1>

<p>__
To upload files to the Ultimaker first get the stl, obj, or other 3D file type and open it with <strong>Cura LulzBot Edition</strong> either through opening through File Explorer or dragging the file into the <strong>Cura LulzBot Edition</strong> application.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>Once the file loads in, you can move it around the buildplate and change it to your likings, or upload more files by dragging them into the application window</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="moving">Moving</h3>
<p>To move the print around the print bed, first click the item you wish to move, then click the (icon) icon and you will see three arrows pop up around your shape</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>Once that happens you can either move it on the main axis by dragging those arrows, or just grab and drag the object to wherever you want it.</p>
<p>You can also set it&rsquo;s exact position with the menu that appears next to the (icon) icon.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>there you will also see two checkboxes, <em>Lock Model</em> and two buttons <em>Center</em> and <em>Bottom</em></p>
<p><em>Lock Model</em> makes it so the model cannot move other than by changing the numbers in the menu, dragging the model or arrows will no longer move it</p>
<p><em>Center</em> will move the object to the center of the buildplate</p>
<p><em>Bottom</em> moves it&rsquo;s lowest point to be touching the print bed.</p>
<p>It is reccomended to keep the <em>Lock Model</em> unselected and hit <em>Bottom</em> before slicing.</p>
<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>
<p>To scale your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three lines with boxes will appear.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>You can grab any of the three to stretch the object in the direction of that line, or instead grab the central box to stratch in all directions equally.</p>
<p>Again a menu will pop up with certain options. The text boxes allow you to set the length, width, or height of the object by measured size or percentage of the original model.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>there you will also see two checkboxes, <em>Snap Scaling</em> and <em>Uniform Scaling</em> as well as a rewind icon, a (icon) icon, and a button that says <em>Bottom</em></p>
<p><em>Snap Scaling</em> makes it so the object will snap between set sizes</p>
<p><em>Uniform Scaling</em> makes it so all the axis will scale uniformly, mneaning any change to one axis will be matched in the other two to keep the proportions of the object the same</p>
<p>The rewind icon will set the object to it&rsquo;s original dimentions, and the (icon) icon will set it to the max size the printer can print.</p>
<p><em>Bottom</em> moves it&rsquo;s lowest point to be touching the print bed.</p>
<p>It is reccomended to keep the <em>Snap Scaling</em> unselected and <em>Uniform Scaling</em> selected unless you intentionally want a off proportion model</p>
<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
<p>To rotate your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three rings will appear.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>You can grab these rings and rotate them to rotate the object how you would like it to print. Keep in mind where the back of the bed is, signified by the lip where it is written <em>Ultimaker S5</em>.</p>
<p>It is reccomended to rotate the object so that the least amount of overhang is acheived:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>And the maximum amount of the print is touching the build plate, shown by the light blue highlight:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Again a menu with certain options will also appear next to the (icon) icon</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>The rewind icon will return the object to it&rsquo;s original orientation</p>
<p>the (icon) icon will rotate the model as little as possible to ensure a flat surface is laying against the print bed.</p>
<p>the (icon) icon will allow you to click on a face of the print and the program will lay it flat against the print bed. This feature is somewhat inconsistent so it may take a few tries to correctly allign it</p>
<p><em>Snap Rotation</em> makes it so the print will only rotate in multiples of 15 degrees.</p>
<p>It is recoomended to keep <em>Snap Rotation</em> selected unless a particular angle is needed.</p>
<h3 id="mirroring">Mirroring</h3>
<p>When you select the (icon) icon, 6 arrows will appear.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>Clicking any of these arrows will mirror the object as if there was a mirror that the arrow was pointed directly into</p>
<h3 id="mesh-type">Mesh Type</h3>
<p>Clicking the (icon) icon will allow you to change how the object prints.</p>
<p>The first icon is the default, and will follow the print settings that you set.</p>
<p>The second prints as if is is support for a different model, which will follow the support settings that you set</p>
<p>The third will deal with overlapping objects, which is much more complicated, and a full desciprion of the options can be found here: link <a href="https://support.makerbot.com/s/article/1667417981430" rel="external" target="_blank">https://support.makerbot.com/s/article/1667417981430</a></p>
<p>The last will remove all supports in the volume of the object, but will not print the object itself</p>
<h3 id="custom-supports">Custom Supports</h3>
<p>To create custom supports, select your object then hit the (icon) icon.</p>
<p>There you will see some options for how you want the support to generate</p>
<p>Once you have set your desired shape, click where on the object you want to support and it will automatically support that spot.</p>
<h3 id="support-blocking">Support blocking</h3>
<p>The (icon) icon will block support in a cubic area, similar to the last option of the last tool</p>
<p>To use this, click the model you want to remove supports from, click the (icon) icon, and then click where you want the blocker. You can then edit the blocker as if it was any other object, using the tools above. The print will not generate any supports in the area of this block.</p>
<h3 id="duplication">Duplication</h3>
<p>To duplicate your object, select the object and then hit the (icon) icon.</p>
<p>A menu will appear and allow you to set how many copies you want. Hit the <em>Multiply</em> button once you have set the desired number</p>
<h3 id="pauses">Pauses</h3>
<p>To add a pause or filament change to your print, select the object and hit the (icon) icon.</p>
<p>There a menu will pop up, with a box to specify what layer you want the filament change at. If instead you just want to pause the print, select the <em>Pause Only</em> box.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>Once you are happy with the object&rsquo;s placement, move to the print settings section.</p>

<h1 id="printer-settings">Printer Settings</h1>

<p>Once you have your object oriented as desired, select your material</p>
<h2 id="material-selection">Material selection</h2>
<p>At the top of the display there will be a dropdown menu to select material type.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Click to show the options for material selection and select the one currently loaded in the printer.</p>
<h2 id="print-settings">Print Settings</h2>
<p>Now move to the print settings menu. There you will see lots of options, which I will briefly review here</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="profiles">Profiles</h3>
<p>Firstly you will see a list of <strong>Profiles</strong>. These are the easiest way to select your settings.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p><em>High Detail</em> prioritizes details and fucntionality. Use this for projects that need to look good or mechanically function.</p>
<p><em>Standard</em> Is a mix of detail and speed. Use this for general printing.</p>
<p><em>High Speed</em> is for quickly printing models that are prototypes or not particularly valuable. Use this for testing and quick prints.</p>
<h3 id="other-settings">Other Settings</h3>
<p>There are lots of other settings that can be adapted, we will breifly review the most important</p>
<h4 id="infill">Infill</h4>
<h5 id="infill-density">Infill Density</h5>
<p>Int the infill section, the <em>Infill Density</em> dropdown will allow you to dictate how much of the interior of the print is filled in, with 0 meaning no fill, and 100 meaning completely full</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>anything down to <em>10%</em> will be self supporting enough, although <em>20%</em> is reccomended for nearly every print. <em>70%</em> is the absolute maximum you need to go for a high strength print, however this should only be used if extreme strength is needed.</p>
<h5 id="infill-pattern">Infill pattern</h5>
<p>This allows for a selection of how the infill will be created, and the options are shown below:</p>
<p>Grid
Lines
Triangles
Trihexagon
Cubic
Cubic Subdivision
Octet
Quarter Cubic
Concentric
Zig Zag
Cross
Cross 3d
Gyroid
Lightning</p>
<p>__ is the reccomended setting but this choice has little effect on the overall print.</p>
<h4 id="support">Support</h4>
<p>Supports are how the printer helps overhangs print, as the printer must always work from bottom to top and cannot print without a surface to print on. Support can be selected and deselected, but is reccomended to use whenever there are overhangs or floating objects in your print</p>
<h4 id="adhesion">Adhesion</h4>
<p>Adhesion provides a way for you to help the print stick to the print bed better. There are a few options for this</p>
<p><em>Skirt</em> Simply outlines the shape before printing it, this does not help much with adhesion though.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p><em>Brim</em> creates a brim of filament around the bottom layer of your print.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Raft</em> creates a small 3d bubble below your print that is very large</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>None</em> generates no adhesion support</p>
<p>It is recommended to select <em>Brim</em> for any print with only a small area touching the bed</p>
<h4 id="vase-mode">Vase Mode</h4>
<p>Vase mode ignores all other settings and prints only the outer wall of your print in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h4 id="custom-settings">Custom settings</h4>
<p>Many other specific settings can be tuned however there are far too many to cover in this guide, so look to a more specific guide on the Cura LulzBot Edition Slicer for information on that.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>Once you have your preferred settings set, move to the slicing files section</p>

<h1 id="slicing-files">Slicing Files</h1>

<p>Once you have set up your print how you want it, press the <em>slice</em> button in the bottom right</p>
<p>insert picture</p>
<p>Once you do this, you will se a new tab appear, <strong>Preview</strong>. This allows you to look at the exact printing path of the printer.</p>
<p>insert image</p>
<p>Here you can use the slider on the right to move up and down the layers, showing each layer path individually, and then use the bottom slider to watch the exact movement path for that layer.</p>
<p>Once you have done this, move to the transferring files section</p>

<h1 id="transferring-and-printng">Transferring and Printng</h1>

<p>To transfer your print to the printer, first make sure the computer is connected to the printer by USB cable, and the printer is on. Then press <em>Print via USB</em> in the box in the bottom right and a new menu will appear with the print settings</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Click the <em>Connect</em> button and wait a few seconds. Eventually the box at the top will read <em>Connected to Printer</em></p>
<p>Once that happens move back to the right menu. Click the <em>Pre-Heat</em> buttons in the <em>Hot End</em> and <em>Build Plate</em> Sections</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Once the printer is heated, hit the <em>Start Print</em> button to begin the print</p>

<h1 id="changing-filament">Changing Filament</h1>

<p>To change filament on the LulzBot, first open the <strong>Cura LulzBot</strong> appliction, and navigate to the monitor tab</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Click the <em>Connect</em> button and wait a few seconds. Eventually the box at the top will read <em>Connected to Printer</em></p>
<p>Once that happens move back to the right menu. Click the <em>Pre-Heat</em> buttons on the <em>Hot End</em> section only.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Then wait until the larger black number changes to match the smaller grey number.</p>
<p>Now scroll down to the <em>Manual Printer Control</em> section</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>Change the number in <em>Extrude Amount</em> to 100, then hit the <em>Retract</em> Button. Then gently pull upwards on the filament.</p>
<p>To load filament, use the same process as above, but set the number to 80 instead of 100 and hit the <em>Extrude</em> button while gently pusing the filament in</p>
