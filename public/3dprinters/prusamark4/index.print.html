<h1 id="uploading-files">Uploading Files</h1>

<hr>
<p>To upload files to the Prusa Printers first get the stl, obj, or other 3D file type and open it with <strong>PrusaSlicer</strong> either through opening through File Explorer or dragging the file into the <strong>PrusaSlicer</strong> application, or clicking the (icon) icon and selecting the file.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>Once the file loads in, you can move it around the buildplate and change it to your likings, or upload more files by dragging them into the application window</p>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>In the top menu you will see a list of options</p>
<p>(icon) will allow you to add a file from file explorer</p>
<p>(icon) will delete the current selected object</p>
<p>(icon) will clear the buildplate of all objects</p>
<p>(icon) will arrange the models on the buildplate</p>
<p>(icon) will copy the selected object</p>
<p>(icon) will paste from the clipboard</p>
<p>(icon) will add a copy of that object</p>
<p>(icon) will remove a copy of that object</p>
<p>(icon) will split a seperated object into multiple objects</p>
<p>(icon) will split a seperated object into multiple parts</p>
<p>(icon) will let you search feature</p>
<p>(icon) will bring up the <em>variable layer height</em> menu which is beyond the scope of this guide and should not be used without a more comprehensive understanding of the printers.</p>
<p>(icon) undoes the last action</p>
<p>(icon) redoes the last undo</p>
<h3 id="moving">Moving</h3>
<p>To move the print around the print bed, first click the item you wish to move, then either drag your shape to its intended position, or click the (icon) icon and you will see three arrows pop up around your shape</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>Once that happens you can either move it on the main axis by dragging those arrows, or just grab and drag the object to wherever you want it.</p>
<p>You can also set it&rsquo;s exact position with the menu on the bottom right of the screen</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>there you will also see a menu with two options <em>World Coordinates</em> and <em>Object Coordinates</em>.</p>
<p><em>World Coordinates</em> lets you set position relative to the bed, with 0,0 being at the bottom left corner.</p>
<p><em>Object Coordinates</em> lets you shift the object from it&rsquo;s current position and will move it as far as you put in. You can also switch to measuring in inches by checking the inches box.</p>
<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>
<p>To scale your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three lines with boxes will appear, as well as a few orange boxes in a square around it.</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>You can grab any of the three to stretch the object in the direction of that line, or instead grab one of the orange boxes to stratch in all directions equally.</p>
<p>You can also set it&rsquo;s exact scale with the menu on the bottom right of the screen</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p><em>Scale Factors</em> allows you to set the scale relative to the original object.</p>
<p><em>Size [World]</em> allows you to set the numeric size along all three axis. You can also switch to measuring in inches by checking the inches box.</p>
<p>If the lock icon is closed, the object will retain it&rsquo;s original proportions and sclae axis equally. If it is open you can manipulate the three seperately.</p>
<p>The rewind icon will set the object to it&rsquo;s original dimentions</p>
<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
<p>To rotate your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three rings will appear.</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>You can grab these rings and rotate them to rotate the object how you would like it to print. Keep in mind where the front of the bed is, signified by where it is written <em>Prusa MK4</em>.</p>
<p>It is reccomended to rotate the object so that the least amount of overhang is acheived:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>And the maximum amount of the print is touching the build plate:</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>You can also set it&rsquo;s exact rotation with the menu on the bottom right of the screen</p>
<p>picture</p>
<p>Putting numbers in the text boxes will rotate the object in the direction of the arrows that appear as many degrees as you insert in the box.</p>
<p>You can also click the (icon) icon and your object will show white planes. Clicking one of these will orient the object so that the selected plane is touching the buildplate.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="cutting">Cutting</h3>
<p>To cut your object in 2 peices, hit the (icon) icon, and a menu will appear, as well as the cutting plane.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>In the menu you will see a selection box labeled <em>Mode</em>. Inside there are two options, <em>Planar</em> and <em>Dovetail</em></p>
<h5 id="planar">Planar</h5>
<p>When you select planar, you should first select where you would like to cut the file. The plane will automatically appear and shade the two halves of the object different colors. To adjust this cut, you can either drag the red and green arrows to tilt the plane, or grab and drag the grey ball to move the plane.</p>
<p>Images</p>
<p>You can also set the height of the cut off of the buildplate automatically in the menu</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>This will create a smooth cut into two peices.</p>
<p>If you want to instead have a more secure way of joining these peices after you cut, press the <em>Add Connectors</em> button</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>From there it will hide one of the two halves, and allow you to place connectors. You will see 3 options for the type of connector, <em>Plug</em>, <em>Dowel</em>, and <em>Snap</em>.</p>
<p>Plug creates a small protrusion from one side, and a matching hole in the other. You can select whther you would like a <em>prisim</em> or <em>frustum</em> shape:</p>
<p>images</p>
<p>As well as what shape you would like it to be, <em>triangle</em>, <em>square</em>, <em>hexagon</em>, or <em>circle</em>:</p>
<p>images</p>
<p>Dowel creates holes in both halves of the print as well as a small dowel to join the two.</p>
<p>Again you can choose the shape of the dowel, <em>triangle</em>, <em>square</em>, <em>hexagon</em>, or <em>circle</em>:</p>
<p>Snap creates a small mechanism which will snap into a hole in the other piece.</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>For all of these options, you can change the Depth out of or into the piece, the horizontal size of the peg, and the rotation around it&rsquo;s center.</p>
<p>For the snap you can alter the bulge of the top section and space between connectors. Hitting the rewind icon will pu tit back to default settings.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with the settings, you can click anywhere on the orange surface to place the connector where you click.</p>
<p>Hit <em>confirm connectors</em> once you are happy with the connector position and settings or <em>cancel</em> to return to the cut menu.</p>
<h5 id="dovetail">Dovetail</h5>
<p>Dovetail will create a unique joint between the two pieces, where one will be able to slide into the other.</p>
<p>The plane will automatically appear and shade the two halves of the object different colors. To adjust this cut, you can either drag the red and green arrows to tilt the plane, grab and drag the white ball to rotate the groove, or grab and drag the grey ball or cube to move the plane.</p>
<p>images</p>
<p>You can also set the height of the cut off of the buildplate automatically in the menu</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>From there you can adjust the settings of the dovetail joint, with the sliders provided. Hitting the rewind icon on any slider will set that slider back to it&rsquo;s default position.</p>
<h4 id="cut-result">Cut Result</h4>
<p>Below the other settings, you will see a section named <em>Cut Result</em>. There you will see a column for each half of the cut. If the check box is selected the cut will generate that pice and not discard it.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>You can then select how to place the object once it cuts. <em>Keep Orientation</em> will keep the object as it is before that cut. <em>Place On Cut</em> will lay the object along the plane of the cut. <em>Flip Upside Down</em> will invert the object.</p>
<p>If you have selected planar and not added connectors, you can at the bottom select to cut into parts instead of objects, which will leave the two sides connected but allow them to have their settings edited seperately with the left parts menu</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="support-painting">Support Painting</h3>
<p>If you press the (icon) icon you can add supports in specific spots by &ldquo;painting&rdquo; with your mouse. Click and drag to add supports where you drag, and right click and drag to block supports in the certain spots you &ldquo;paint&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>You can also automatically paint areas, edit where can be painted, and edit your &ldquo;brush&rdquo; shape in the menu below.</p>
<h3 id="seam-painting">Seam Painting</h3>
<p>If you press the (icon) icon you can controll where each layer of the print starts and ends, creating a small slightly visible seam.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Clicking and dragging will force the printer to place a seam there, and right clicking and dragging will stop seams in that area.</p>
<p>You can also change the shape of your brush and view options in the menu that appears.</p>
<h3 id="measuring">Measuring</h3>
<p>To measure your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon. You can then click individual faces, edges, and points to measure the distance, angle, and areas of the parts selected.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>When you measure a length, a (icon) icon will appear, and allow you to change the length highlighted and scale the rest of the model to enforce that length.</p>
<p>In the menu you can either hit the <em>Restart Selection</em> button to clear your selection, or click the (icon) icon next to the measures to copy the numbers there.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>Once you are happy with the object&rsquo;s placement, move to the print settings section.</p>

<h1 id="printer-settings">Printer Settings</h1>

<hr>
<p>Once you are satified with the object placement, move to the right menu.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="print-settings">Print settings</h3>
<p>Here you will see a list of settings for layer heights:</p>
<p>0.1 mm will be the most prescise setting, good for visual detail or mechanical fucntionality</p>
<p>0.15 mm has both SPEED and STRUCTURAL options, choose SPEED for a faster print, or STRUCTURAL for a sturdier print.</p>
<p>0.2 mm has the same options, but both will be faster but lower quality than their 0.15 mm counterparts</p>
<h3 id="filament">Filament</h3>
<p>Here you can select the type of filament to be printed. Make sure this matches what is loaded in the printer before printing.</p>
<h3 id="printer">Printer</h3>
<p>Here you select which printer to use. Select <strong>Original Prusa MK4 Input Shaper 0.4 nozzle</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="supports">Supports</h3>
<p>Supports are how the printer helps overhangs print, as the printer must always work from bottom to top and cannot print without a surface to print on. Support can be selected and deselected, but is reccomended to use whenever there are overhangs or floating objects in your print</p>
<p>The options in the dropdown designate where supports generate, and gives 4 options, <em>None</em>, <em>Support on Buildplate Only</em>, <em>For Support Enforcers Only</em>, and <em>Everywhere</em>.</p>
<p><em>None</em> will not create any supports</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Support on Buildplate Only</em> will only support overhangs over the buildplate, and overhangs that have other bits of object below will not generate support</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>For Support Enforcers Only</em> only puts supports in specified spots, either by you or the model itself.</p>
<p><em>Everywhere</em> means any overhang will be supported, no matter where on the print it is.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>It is reccomended to use <em>Everywhere</em> when overhangs are present.</p>
<h3 id="infill">Infill</h3>
<p>This will allow you to dictate how much of the interior of the print is filled in, with 0 meaning no fill, and 100 meaning completely full</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>anything down to <em>10%</em> will be self supporting enough, although <em>20%</em> is reccomended for nearly every print. <em>70%</em> is the absolute maximum you need to go for a high strength print, however this should only be used if extreme strength is needed.</p>
<h3 id="brim">Brim</h3>
<p>The brim helps prints stick to the print bed and avoid shifting and warping off of the bed. It is reccomended to keep this setting selected for any print.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="part-specific-settings">Part specific settings.</h3>
<p>In the part menu, you can select and change settings for specific parts by clicking the (icon) icon</p>
<p>The full scope of this will not be covered on this website.</p>
<h3 id="custom-settings">Custom Settings</h3>
<p>In the top left you will see tabs wil more settings. These can affect more specific things about the print and printer but that is only reccomneded to use if you are more comfortable with the printer and how it works.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>Once your settings are as desired, move to the slicing section.</p>

<h1 id="slicefiles">SliceFiles</h1>

<p>Once you have set up your print how you want it, press the <em>slice</em> button in the bottom right</p>
<p>insert picture</p>
<p>Once you do this, you will se a new tab appear, <strong>Preview</strong>. This allows you to look at the exact printing path of the printer.</p>
<p>insert image</p>
<p>Here you can use the slider on the right to move up and down the layers, showing each layer path individually, and then use the bottom slider to watch the exact movement path for that layer.</p>
<h3 id="adding-breaks">Adding breaks</h3>
<p>You can add breaks, custom g-code, and filament swaps into your print from here, by sliding the slider on the right to where you want and either clicking the (icon) icon to add a color swap, or right clicking to choose between pause, custom g-code, and color swaps.</p>
<p>Pauses will stop the print and let you either add parts into the print or check the print, and resume when you press a button on the printer. Add custom g-code will have the printer run a set custom g-code file. Color swap will do the same as regular clicking.</p>
<p>If you choose to do a filament swap, make sure you are using the same type of filament.</p>
<h3 id="view-settings">View Settings</h3>
<p>You can also see specific parts of the print broken down by type of print and shaded different colors, as well as a menu of options at the bottom. This lets you view mroe specific information about the print.</p>
