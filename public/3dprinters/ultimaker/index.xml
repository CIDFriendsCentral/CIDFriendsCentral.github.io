    <description> The ultimaker is the biggest printer here in the CID and has the biggest build volume. It is also in my opinion the easiest to use. These guides are used to print with this printer:&#xA;Uploading Files&#xA;Printer Settings&#xA;Slicing Files&#xA;Transferring to printer&#xA;Printing</description>

      <description> To upload files to the Ultimaker first get the stl, obj, or other 3D file type and open it with UltiMaker Cura either through opening through File Explorer or dragging the file into the UltiMaker Cura application.&#xA;Once the file loads in, you can move it around the buildplate and change it to your likings, or upload more files by dragging them into the application window.</description>

      <description> Once you have your gcode file, take the USB drive out of the printer and plug it into the computer. You can ignore any windows that pop up after doing this. Navigate back to UltiMaker Cura and look to the bottom right. If the button says Save To Removable Drive click it. If not, click the up arrow, then click Save To Removable Drive to make the button read Save To Removable Drive, then click the button.</description>

      <description> Most errors with the UltiMaker will create an error message accompanied by the QR code. If this happens scan the QR code to find out how to fix the error.&#xA;The most common errors occur when:&#xA;The white silicone cover is not on the print heads: To fix this reinsert the silicone cover.&#xA;The printer thinks it does not have filament loaded but does: To fix hit the OK button and hit resume when it returns to the printing screen, the printer will figure out that it does in fact have filament.</description>
