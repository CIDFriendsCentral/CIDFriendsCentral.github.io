This will lay the face of the rectangular box around the object flat against the bed.\nImage\nFinally the Reset Selected Button will return the object to it’s original orientation.\nScaling To scale your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon. A menu will appear next to the icon.\nPicture\nThe text boxes allow you to set the scale of the object by a multiple of it’s current size and scale it evenly across all axis, or scale the axis seperately to the size you specify.\npicture\nThe Reset button will set the object to it’s original dimentions\nAlternatively, when you select the object you can grab and drag the (icon) icon the scale it evenly.\nLayout To manage the layout of the bed, select your object and hit the (icon) icon. A menu will then appear.\nImage\nAuto Layout To automatically layout your objects, you can change the Model Spacing and choose whether to select Overlap Rafts and Lock Rotation. Then hit the Layout All Button.\nModel Spacing Will dictate how close the pieces end up after placement.\nImage\nOverlap Rafts dictates if the support rafts can overlap\nImage\nLock Rotation stops the program from rotating the models while arranging them.\nDuplication To duplicate your model, first select how many copies you want, then hit the Create button\nArray Array will duplicate your models in a regular pattern, with a specified number of rows and columns and specified spacing.\nMirroring Hit the Mirror Models button to mirror all selected models.\nSupports To generate supports for your model, hit the (icon) icon and a menu will appear. If you select an object or objects, you can generate supports only for the selected objects, or alternatively generate supports for all objects by not selecting any one particular object.\nImage\nFirstly, you can automatically generate the supports by hitting the Auto-Generate All Button.\nImage\nYou can paint on supports by hitting the Edit button, but the details of that will not be covered here. It is reccomended to use the Auto-Generate option instead.\nYou can edit the way supports generate in the Basic Settings section.\nRaft Type will change how the support raft generates, either Full Rafts, Mini Rafts, or None\nImage\nRaft Label will place the name of the object on the rim of the raft\nImage\nDensity Changes how often the supports will be placed\nTouchpoint Size Changes the area of the contact between the support and object\nInternal Supports will generate supports between different layers of the object\nAdvanced Settings has more particular details but will not be covered on this guide.\nHitting the Reset button will reset the objects completely.\nOnce you are happy with object and support placement, move to the Printer Settings Section.",

You can also switch to measuring in inches by checking the inches box.\nScaling To scale your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three lines with boxes will appear, as well as a few orange boxes in a square around it.\nPicture\nYou can grab any of the three to stretch the object in the direction of that line, or instead grab one of the orange boxes to stratch in all directions equally.\nYou can also set it’s exact scale with the menu on the bottom right of the screen\npicture\nScale Factors allows you to set the scale relative to the original object.\nSize [World] allows you to set the numeric size along all three axis. You can also switch to measuring in inches by checking the inches box.\nIf the lock icon is closed, the object will retain it’s original proportions and sclae axis equally. If it is open you can manipulate the three seperately.\nThe rewind icon will set the object to it’s original dimentions\nRotation To rotate your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon, and three rings will appear.\npicture\nYou can grab these rings and rotate them to rotate the object how you would like it to print. Keep in mind where the front of the bed is, signified by where it is written Prusa MK4.\nIt is reccomended to rotate the object so that the least amount of overhang is acheived:\nimage\nAnd the maximum amount of the print is touching the build plate:\nimage\nYou can also set it’s exact rotation with the menu on the bottom right of the screen\npicture\nPutting numbers in the text boxes will rotate the object in the direction of the arrows that appear as many degrees as you insert in the box.\nYou can also click the (icon) icon and your object will show white planes. Clicking one of these will orient the object so that the selected plane is touching the buildplate.\nImage\nCutting To cut your object in 2 peices, hit the (icon) icon, and a menu will appear, as well as the cutting plane.\nImage\nIn the menu you will see a selection box labeled Mode. Inside there are two options, Planar and Dovetail\nPlanar When you select planar, you should first select where you would like to cut the file. The plane will automatically appear and shade the two halves of the object different colors. To adjust this cut, you can either drag the red and green arrows to tilt the plane, or grab and drag the grey ball to move the plane.\nImages\nYou can also set the height of the cut off of the buildplate automatically in the menu\nimage\nThis will create a smooth cut into two peices.\nIf you want to instead have a more secure way of joining these peices after you cut, press the Add Connectors button\nimage\nFrom there it will hide one of the two halves, and allow you to place connectors. You will see 3 options for the type of connector, Plug, Dowel, and Snap.\nPlug creates a small protrusion from one side, and a matching hole in the other. You can select whther you would like a prisim or frustum shape:\nimages\nAs well as what shape you would like it to be, triangle, square, hexagon, or circle:\nimages\nDowel creates holes in both halves of the print as well as a small dowel to join the two.\nAgain you can choose the shape of the dowel, triangle, square, hexagon, or circle:\nSnap creates a small mechanism which will snap into a hole in the other piece.\nimage\nFor all of these options, you can change the Depth out of or into the piece, the horizontal size of the peg, and the rotation around it’s center.\nFor the snap you can alter the bulge of the top section and space between connectors. Hitting the rewind icon will pu tit back to default settings.\nOnce you are happy with the settings, you can click anywhere on the orange surface to place the connector where you click.\nHit confirm connectors once you are happy with the connector position and settings or cancel to return to the cut menu.\nDovetail Dovetail will create a unique joint between the two pieces, where one will be able to slide into the other.\nThe plane will automatically appear and shade the two halves of the object different colors. To adjust this cut, you can either drag the red and green arrows to tilt the plane, grab and drag the white ball to rotate the groove, or grab and drag the grey ball or cube to move the plane.\nimages\nYou can also set the height of the cut off of the buildplate automatically in the menu\nimage\nFrom there you can adjust the settings of the dovetail joint, with the sliders provided. Hitting the rewind icon on any slider will set that slider back to it’s default position.\nCut Result Below the other settings, you will see a section named Cut Result. There you will see a column for each half of the cut. If the check box is selected the cut will generate that pice and not discard it.\nImage\nYou can then select how to place the object once it cuts. Keep Orientation will keep the object as it is before that cut. Place On Cut will lay the object along the plane of the cut. Flip Upside Down will invert the object.\nIf you have selected planar and not added connectors, you can at the bottom select to cut into parts instead of objects, which will leave the two sides connected but allow them to have their settings edited seperately with the left parts menu\nImage\nSupport Painting If you press the (icon) icon you can add supports in specific spots by “painting” with your mouse. Click and drag to add supports where you drag, and right click and drag to block supports in the certain spots you “paint”.\nImage\nYou can also automatically paint areas, edit where can be painted, and edit your “brush” shape in the menu below.\nSeam Painting If you press the (icon) icon you can controll where each layer of the print starts and ends, creating a small slightly visible seam.\nImage\nClicking and dragging will force the printer to place a seam there, and right clicking and dragging will stop seams in that area.\nYou can also change the shape of your brush and view options in the menu that appears.\nMeasuring To measure your object, select the object, then select the (icon) icon. You can then click individual faces, edges, and points to measure the distance, angle, and areas of the parts selected.\nImage\nWhen you measure a length, a (icon) icon will appear, and allow you to change the length highlighted and scale the rest of the model to enforce that length.\nIn the menu you can either hit the Restart Selection button to clear your selection, or click the (icon) icon next to the measures to copy the numbers there.\nDone? Once you are happy with the object’s placement, move to the print settings section.",
