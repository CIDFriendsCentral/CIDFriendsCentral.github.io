<h1 id="adjust-settings">Adjust Settings</h1>

<hr>
<p>Once you have your material selected, we can start choosing how we want each shape to be cut.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>On the left of the screen will show all individual objects in the workspace. Click on the object you wish to change the settings of.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<h3 id="cut-options">Cut Options</h3>
<p>A menu will appear, with various options. First let&rsquo;s look at the top menu. Each of the options on the top menu will cut the object in a different way.</p>
<h4 id="engraving">Engraving</h4>
<p>Engraving will have the laser cutter burn an area into your material but not cut all the way through.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>If you have a shape with a simple boundry this will just fill in the shape.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>But if you have an image instead, the engraving will attempt to create a pattern to make the image.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Clicking the arrow next to the default setting will open up a menu of more options.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Speed</em> controls how fast the laser moves, and <em>Power</em> controls how much pwer the laser outputs.</p>
<p>If you have an image, there will be a panel labeled <em>Bitmap Options</em></p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>The dropdown labeled <em>Grayscale</em> will let you choose how darkness is interpreted by the computer.</p>
<p><em>Convert to dots</em> will add more small dots in darker areas and less in lighter areas.</p>
<p><em>Convert to patterns</em> will add a darker pattern in darker areas and a lighter pattern in lighter areas</p>
<p><em>Vary Power</em> will use more power in darker areas and more in lighter areas, with the maximun power being the number specified in the previous panel and the minimum power being specified in a box just below the dropdown.</p>
<p>For either of the first two options a slider labeled <em>Pattern Density</em> will appear, where the left gray bar designates the lightest pattern the printer will create and the right bar designating the darkest pattern the printer will create.</p>
<p>For any of the three options, there is a slider that will change how the edge of the image is managed, between minimizing the margin and maximizing the quality of the image.</p>
<p>Finally there will be options labeled <em>Engrave</em></p>
<p><em>Lines per inch</em> designates how many lines the laser will make per inch</p>
<p><em># of Passes</em>  designates how many passes the laser will do during the engraving process</p>
<p><em>Focus Height</em> can be changed from a manual to automatic focus. It is recommended to set it to <em>Auto</em></p>
<h4 id="cutting">Cutting</h4>
<p>The cut setting will cut the outline of the selected object</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Clicking the arrow next to the default setting will open up a menu of more options.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Speed</em> controls how fast the laser moves, and <em>Power</em> controls how much pwer the laser outputs.</p>
<p>If the laser does not cut all the way through, turn down the speed by 10-20 and try again</p>
<p><em># of Passes</em>  designates how many passes the laser will do during the cutting process</p>
<p><em>Focus Height</em> can be changed from a manual to automatic focus. It is recommended to set it to <em>Auto</em></p>
<h4 id="scoring">Scoring</h4>
<p>Scoring will engrave just the outline of the shape but not cut all the way through.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Clicking the arrow next to the default setting will open up a menu of more options.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p><em>Speed</em> controls how fast the laser moves, and <em>Power</em> controls how much pwer the laser outputs.</p>
<p><em># of Passes</em>  designates how many passes the laser will do during the engraving process</p>
<p><em>Focus Height</em> can be changed from a manual to automatic focus. It is recommended to set it to <em>Auto</em></p>
<h4 id="ignoring">Ignoring</h4>
<p>Ignore will make the cutter completely ignore the object and not cut it at all</p>
<h2 id="done">Done?</h2>
<p>Once you have your settings set, move to the Process Ordering page.</p>

<h1 id="process-ordering">Process Ordering</h1>

<p>Once you have your cut settings set, close out any open menus.</p>
<p>Now it is important to order the cuts in an appropriate order.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>The cutter will do the steps in the left bar from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Take any engraving and scoring steps, and drag them upwards, and take any cutting steps and drag them downwards. This way peices will not move after being cut and be misaligned for engraving.</p>
<p>Once you are done this, move to Printing.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="cutter-selection">Cutter selection</h3>
<p>Before cutting make sure you have the right cutter selected by clicking the name of the glowforge in the top right and selecting which machine you are using</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Glowforge&rdquo; has the slot in the front for passthrough cutting while the &ldquo;Glowforge II&rdquo; does not.</p>
<h3 id="last-rearrangment">Last rearrangment</h3>
<p>Once you are ready to print, look at the material image on the workspace and make sure that the object is in the right location.</p>
<p>The two things to look out for are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your object is not over any holes in your material.</li>
</ol>
<p>image</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If possible, try to move your object to leave the biggest space possible for others to cut.</li>
</ol>
<p>image</p>
<h3 id="printing">Printing</h3>
<p>When you are ready to print, click the <em>Print</em> button in the top right</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>From there the printer will begin the printing process, and eventually show a menu.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>When this menu shows, check once again that your object is not over any holes as the bed image often shifts slightly when you do this.</p>
<p>Once you are confident it will print correctly, move to the laser cutter and hit the flashing white button. Your design should begin printing.</p>
<p>If you need to cancel at any time, just hit the cancel print button on the computer.</p>

<h1 id="tracing">Tracing</h1>

<p>To trace an image into the laser cutter, place the drawing or art you wish to trace in the machine and close the lid.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Then either go to the glowforge home menu and hit <em>Create New Design</em> and <em>Trace Artwork</em> or open a workspace and hit the (icon) icon and then the <em>Trace</em> button in the top right. This will open up an image of the bed and anything in it.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Now simply drag your mouse over the art you wish to trace.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>This will show a black and white scan of the artwork. If you wish to cut an outline of any section of the art, click that area and it will outline it in purple.</p>
<p>Images</p>
<p>Once you have selected all areas to cut, hit the <em>Place Artwork</em> button in the top right.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>This will place an engraving of the art, as well as cut lines anywhere you selected, with the two grouped together. Right click and hit <em>Ungroup</em> to seperate the two.</p>

<h3 id="cutter-setup">Cutter Setup</h3>
<p>To activate passthrough, first set up the cutter to let objects pass through it.</p>
<p>To do this, first open the lid, open the front compartment, and pull out the black tray.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>You will then see in the front and back 2 black screws.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>Twist these to remove them and the attached bar, and set them aside somewhere safe.</p>
<p>Image</p>
<p>You can then place the tray back in, and close the front and the lid.</p>
<p>Now insert your material so that the closest edge to you is ligned up with the front of the black tray, and the back stciks out through the back flap on the cutter.</p>
